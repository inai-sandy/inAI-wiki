Title: DeepSeek-OCR Smashes AI Context Limits: 100 Vision Tokens Replace 1,000+ Text, Code Public
Description: DeepSeek-OCR flips the script on how AIs “remember”—using just 100 vision tokens to compress what would take 1,000+ text tokens, with 97% retrieval accuracy. This unlocks ultra-long context for LLMs, hinting at a future where images super-compress memory (not just OCR docs). It could reshape model training, inference costs, and how we handle long-term AI memory.
