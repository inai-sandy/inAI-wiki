Title: Rachoon ‚Äî Self-Hosted Invoicing Made Simple

Description: Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been working on a self-hosted invoicing app called Rachoon (the name comes from the Bosnian word raƒçun , which means invoice). I built it because I wanted something lightweight, fully under my control. It all started back in 2016 when I became self-employed where I needed something to create invoices. At first I used a proprietary SaaS product, which was a good product itself, but their support was miserable - to say the least. I looked at self-hosted alternatives which - at that time - looked to basic for my needs. So I took matters into my own hands, and started working on Rachoon. I got it to a point where it served my needs more than well, and kept using it privately, hosted on my HomeLab. Now that I have more time, I decided to make it production ready for everyone else to use. Here‚Äôs what it does: Create and manage invoices and quotes Keep track of clients and payments Highly customizable invoice templates with your branding using nunjucks Generate PDFs and previews Support for multiple currencies and taxes It‚Äôs open source, so I‚Äôve been able to tweak things to fit my workflow, and I can see how it would be useful for freelancers or small teams who want to keep everything local. If you‚Äôre into self-hosting and want to avoid subscription invoicing tools, it might be worth checking out: https://github.com/ad-on-is/rachoon I‚Äôm happy to answer questions about setup or how I‚Äôve been using it in my own workflow.
