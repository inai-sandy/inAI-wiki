**Title:** The 'Memory' Illusion: Why ChatGPT Remembers (and Local LLMs Never Do)

**Description:**  
Ever felt like ChatGPT remembers your whole conversation unlike local LLMs? That's not the model—it's the heavy-lifting "platform layer" doing custom instructions, history, and continuity. Local setups often lack this, making them "forgetful." True LLM memory still relies on clever, external scaffolding—so tools like RAG, plugins, and knowledge bases matter just as much as the model itself.

**Title:** FLI 2025 Report: Most Top AI Labs Still Get “F” in Existential Safety

**Description:**  
The latest Future of Life Institute (FLI) report grades major AI companies on safety. Shocker: Most received an “F” for existential safeguards—meaning they openly admit no robust control mechanisms for powerful AIs. With AGI possible in coming years, the race seems to outpace the brakes. The open letter for better oversight gathers names, but real change is still up in the air.

**Title:** Alibaba's Sora2 & Teens: California Law Threatens OpenAI’s For-Profit Future

**Description:**  
If a new California ballot blocks OpenAI's for-profit shift, the company might need viral hits (like Sora2’s user engagement) to survive—or risk valuation collapse.
