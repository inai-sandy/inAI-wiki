Title: Diversity Collapse in LLMs: The Hidden Threat NeurIPS Just Sounded the Alarm On  
Description: Too many LLMs become generic “AI slop” after post-training (RLHF), losing creative diversity—a crisis called “diversity collapse.” Recent NeurIPS Best Paper warns this not only makes AI text detectable, it could impact human culture as we imitate collapsed output. But new research shows finetuning and adversarial training can bring back creativity and make high-quality AI writing undetectable. Don’t miss this essential paradigm shift for anyone building with—or against—AI-generated content.
