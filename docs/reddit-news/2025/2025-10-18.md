Title: Breakthrough "RLMs" Promise Infinite Context for LLMs—No More Token Limits?
Description: A new class of models called Retrieval-based Language Models (RLMs) lets AIs handle virtually infinite context. Instead of cramming everything into the model at once, an orchestrator agent smartly breaks down and fetches relevant information, enabling long-horizon tasks and better memory. It's early, but this could be a game-changer for applications like research assistants and writing tools.
