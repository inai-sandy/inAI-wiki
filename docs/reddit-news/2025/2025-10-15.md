**Title:** $2B to Reflection AI, n8n’s $180M, AWS AgentCore: The AI Agent Funding Frenzy Hits New Heights  
**Description:**  
From Reflection AI’s $2B raise to AWS’s new Bedrock AgentCore, investments in AI agents have surged this week. Orchestration (n8n, $180M), back-end infrastructure (Supabase, $100M), and specialized tools for enterprise workflows (Salesforce Agentforce 360) are stealing the spotlight. AI agents for compliance, fraud prevention, and voice analytics drew big rounds, underscoring the rush to automate everything from software builds to KYC.  
  
**Title:** Anthropic: A Few Poisoned Samples Can Backdoor Any LLM—No Matter the Size  
**Description:**  
Anthropic’s new research reveals that injecting just a few malicious examples during training can “poison” large language models, regardless of scale. This means attackers need to slip in only a tiny, fixed number of bad data points to insert hidden model behaviors—posing wider risks as model training datasets balloon.
