Title: AI Agents in Education and News: "Einstein" Bots & Transparency Frameworks  
Description:  
Rethink school and journalism: The rise of AI “proxy students” like “Einstein” (attending classes and handing in work for you) is sparking urgent debate on the value and risks of education in the LLM era. Meanwhile, Hypervisor Studio advances a framework (GAIT) for transparency in game AI, akin to nutrition facts for code, to address authenticity and ethics. Both signal a coming wave of agentic AI scrutiny and governance in learning and content.
