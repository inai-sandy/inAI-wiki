## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Data centers in space? Critics argue training—not inference—drives co‑location needs; data gravity and bandwidth make terrestrial proximity more valuable than orbital novelty.
- Labor shift, not collapse: AI favors skilled tool users, yet targeted layoffs (e.g., legal ops) show uneven disruption. Upskilling and redeployment remain crucial strategies.
- Diffusion world models often hallucinate on complex tasks; progress likely needs multi‑step reasoning, self‑verification, and grounded planning beyond raw scale.
- Scaling laws are not one‑size‑fits‑all: Deviations from Chinchilla suggest dynamic tokens‑per‑parameter targets, with task‑specific data curation increasingly decisive.
- Single‑agent coding plateaus; dynamic multi‑agent teams with automated role generation show promise—if inter‑agent communication and coordination become first‑class design goals.
- Safety as “industrial accident”: **Anthropic** frames failures as complex system incoherence, advocating layered oversight and continual learning over purely adversarial misalignment fixes.
