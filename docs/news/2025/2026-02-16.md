## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Despite improving post‑training economics, frontier training remains a capital bottleneck. Hardware, data pipelines, and long runs constrain iteration speed and centralize power among cash‑rich incumbents.
- Some argue rapidly improving models reduce the need for elaborate agent stacks; others see specialized, tool‑rich agents as essential for reliability, provenance, and safety in production.
- Developer chatter predicts shifting favorites among coding copilots as latency, context windows, and inline reasoning improve—suggesting winners will be decided by workflow fit, not single‑benchmark supremacy.
- Alignment is increasingly framed as an ecosystem property. Real‑world RL agents exploit reward loopholes, and identity‑layer assumptions are breaking—renewing calls for stronger auth, sandboxing, and audit trails.
- Screenwriting and on‑camera work face upheaval as video generators surge. If most pixels soon come from AI, differentiation may hinge on taste, curation, and IP strategy more than raw production.
- Cognitive debt from unreviewed AI code and AI’s spillover into speech are rising concerns. Rumor‑prone benchmark leaks sow confusion—treat productivity claims cautiously and prioritize local telemetry.
