## 📑 Research & Papers
- **DeepMind’s Aletheia** reframes LLMs as autonomous math researchers, pairing conjecture generation with self‑verification. Early results suggest scalable discovery workflows that could generalize to science planning and formal reasoning.
- New attention mechanisms with long KV caches and sparse lookup extended memory at near‑linear cost, pointing to practical multi‑million‑token contexts without prohibitive compute—crucial for long‑running agents and large documents.
- Efficiency gains: **MICE** sped re‑ranking by dropping extraneous attention, and **ColBERT‑Zero** achieved BEIR state‑of‑the‑art using only public data—lowering retrieval costs while improving search quality.
- **InftyThink+** trained models to pause and review intermediate steps via trajectory‑level reinforcement learning, improving robustness on reasoning tasks and offering a template for safer, self‑auditing chains‑of‑thought.
- Technical releases: **Mistral’s Voxtral Realtime** detailed low‑latency streaming for voice agents, while **EVMbench** (OpenAI + Paradigm) standardized testing AI on smart‑contract vulnerabilities—sharpening safety for conversational and blockchain systems.

## 🏢 Industry & Policy
- **OpenAI** is reportedly nearing a $100B raise, with valuations floated near $830B. The capital would accelerate safety research, infrastructure, and product bets amid intensifying competition.
- India push: **OpenAI** and **Tata** plan AI data centers from 100MW toward 1GW; partnerships with **Reliance JioHotstar** and **Pine Labs** target multilingual search, payments, and enterprise adoption across the region.
- Enterprise adoption and infra: **Accenture** ties promotions to AI usage after $1B training; **Temporal** raised $300M to harden long‑running agent apps with robust logging and recovery—signaling production‑grade AI expectations.
- Global governance gathered steam: **Sam Altman** urged nuclear‑style oversight; the **UN** and **EU** advanced inclusive, anti‑disinformation frameworks; and **OpenAI** plus **Microsoft** joined a UK coalition for ethical alignment.
- Security escalated: **PromptSpy** Android malware leveraged **Gemini** for evasive attacks, while **Google Play**’s AI blocked 1.75M harmful apps—illustrating fast‑evolving offense and defense in mobile ecosystems.
- Courts clarified risk: U.S. rulings held chats on public AI lack legal privilege. Separately, a misconfigured app leaked 300M AI messages—underscoring the need for secure, enterprise‑grade deployments.

## 📚 Tutorials & Guides

- **ZeitZeuge** tied into unit tests to profile V8 CPU usage and auto‑propose code‑level fixes, previewing agentic performance engineering that closes the loop from diagnostics to remediation.

## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Why AI hasn’t moved macro indicators yet: leaders cite bottlenecks in tooling, data readiness, and deployment. Consensus leans toward ecosystems and production infrastructure, not raw model IQ, as decisive drivers.
- A new “harness engineer” role is emerging—to wrap, steer, and safeguard agents with tests, guardrails, and policies—bridging research prototypes and dependable, auditable systems.
- Reliability warnings: LLMs may attempt unauthorized tool calls; secure coding and patching remain weak; identity systems weren’t built for autonomous agents—demanding human verification for critical operations.
- Disclosure studies are mixed: labeling AI authorship shapes trust but doesn’t reliably reduce persuasiveness; even super‑recognizers struggle to spot deepfakes—raising stakes for provenance and authentication.
- Technical trade‑offs: higher “reasoning” settings can degrade quality and inflate costs; careful data curation yields order‑of‑magnitude efficiency gains; strong multilingual data need not dilute English performance.
- AGI timelines tightened—**Demis Hassabis** floated five years; **Sam Altman** eyed superintelligence by 2028. Work on **DSPy** and modular agents could unlock more capable personal assistants en route.
