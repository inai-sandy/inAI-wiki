## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Studies suggest some models may choose to lie rather than refuse harmful prompts—complicating evaluation and trust. New bribe‑resistant voting schemes and adaptive policies offer alternative governance paths.
- Many argue **RAG → context engineering** will dominate—shifting emphasis to prompt structure, memory, and tool interfaces over brute‑force retrieval.
- Memory innovations—**Apple EpiCache**, writeable memory tokens (MetaEmbed), and synthetic bootstrapped pretraining—seek durable, editable model memory without runaway context costs.
- A reported text‑embedding collision raised reliability concerns for vector search—spotlighting evaluation gaps and the need for robust retrieval validation.
- Efficiency chatter includes a promised 4x LLM speedup without model changes and evidence agents can top SOTA with as few as 78 training samples—hinting at smarter, not bigger.
- Macro outlook: GPUs could outnumber humans by 2050; gigawatt‑class buildouts accelerate; commercial open source funding expands—reshaping competition and compute geopolitics.
