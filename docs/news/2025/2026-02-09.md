## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Trust philosophies diverge: **OpenAI**’s rule‑centric governance versus **Anthropic**’s character‑centric approach, fueling debate on how to scale dependable systems and align incentives across ecosystems.

- Benchmark fatigue set in as MMLU/GSM8K saturate; researchers push community, task‑grounded evals mirroring production constraints—latency, failure recovery, long‑horizon memory—over leaderboard chasing.

- Many foresee a software industrial revolution: consumer models deliver instant answers, while high‑end agentic stacks supercharge power users—multiplying code output and shifting value capture to orchestration layers.

- Counter‑narratives to “AI is slowing” emphasize relentless capability gains and collapsing costs, enabling full‑stack prototypes for pennies and faster product iteration.

- Builders spotlight “compounders”—framework and engine creators—as new leverage points, advocating intentional AI system design over trial‑and‑error and exploring self‑referential agents (e.g., Codex prompting Codex).

- Engineering critiques warned about enlarged LLM attack surfaces, hidden “grep tax” on structured data, and persistent hyperparameter tuning bottlenecks that still throttle reliability and scale.
