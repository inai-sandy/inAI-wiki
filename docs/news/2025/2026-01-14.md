- **NVIDIA test‑time training (E2E)** — End‑to‑end methods that improve knowledge retention during inference. Reduces context loss and helps models adapt without full retraining.
- **DeepSeek Engram + MCHC** — O(1) memory lookup and Manifold‑Constrained Hyper‑Connections stabilize deep networks. A step toward more reliable long‑term memory and deeper architectures.
- **Hidden‑action learning** — Models infer actions from internet video without explicit labels. Enhances embodied and robotics learning where annotations are scarce or noisy.
- **TTT‑E2E for genomics** — Long‑sequence modeling breakthroughs enable end‑to‑end learning on genomic data, opening doors to faster discovery pipelines and precision medicine.

## 🏢 Industry & Policy
- **Apple + Google Gemini** — A multi‑year, ~$1B deal will supercharge Siri and Apple Intelligence with Gemini while keeping data private within Apple’s stack. Intensifies mobile AI competition and spurs antitrust debate.
- **OpenAI x Torch (health)** — OpenAI’s ~$100M acquisition and ChatGPT Health push aim to unify fragmented medical data with strong privacy. UK/EU rules heighten compliance and trust requirements for AI health tools.
- **Agentic commerce accelerates** — **Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol** (backed by Walmart and Shopify) plus Gemini assistants for retailers (Kroger, Papa Johns) and **JD Sports** in‑assistant checkout signal mainstream AI shopping.
- **Crackdown on AI harms** — Governments consider bans over **Grok**‑linked explicit images; **Malaysia** plans legal action against X; a U.S. arrest for AI‑generated CSEM fuels calls for stronger safeguards and oversight.
- **Nvidia acquires Slurm** — The move from legacy HPC scheduling toward cloud‑native AI stacks quickens. Enterprises eye smoother migrations, better utilization, and unified orchestration across clusters and clouds.
- **Healthcare at scale** — **ARPA‑H’s ADVOCATE** program deploys agentic AI for rural heart disease care, aiming to personalize management, tackle clinician shortages, and shave tens of billions from annual costs.

## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Beyond scale — Analysts say returns from brute‑force scaling fade; the next levers are verifiable reasoning, memory, interpretability, and robust agent design.
- Trust the judge? — “LLM judges” need human‑validated testing to be credible. Without rigorous evaluation, automated grading risks enshrining bias and shortcutting progress.
- Benchmarks vs business value — Calls grow to measure real outcomes, adopting test‑driven AI development and treating prompt iterations as serious engineering, not “vibe coding.”
- What is “understanding”? — Debates revive over whether LLMs understand language, urging operational definitions tied to reliable, falsifiable behaviors.
- Safety and ops — Limits of asynchronous monitoring surface; practitioners advocate for “boring,” reliable agents that minimize hallucinations and failure modes in enterprise contexts.
