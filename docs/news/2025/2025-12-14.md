- Studies find AI code reviewers routinely miss critical issues in real projects—evidence that human oversight and hybrid workflows remain essential for production quality.
- **Stanford** highlights that models still struggle to detect user misconceptions; prompts, UI scaffolding, and tool integration must better surface and correct false beliefs.
- New frames emphasize agent/tool adaptation over raw scaling; some foresee agents “sleeping” between tasks to self‑critique, refine strategies, and cut inference waste.
- Macro signals: compute costs keep plunging while investment lags; worries about office‑job displacement rise; hyper‑personalization becomes practical—reshaping product design and policy debates.
