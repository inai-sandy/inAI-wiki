## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Experts argued there’s no single “god model”; choosing the right tool for the task beats chasing monolithic state‑of‑the‑art rankings.
- Emerging evidence suggests teaching reasoning earlier in pretraining—and using supervised fine‑tuning strategically—can reduce catastrophic forgetting and improve generalization.
- A formal limit on information learned per episode from policy gradients reframes expectations for long‑horizon RL, motivating hybrid methods and better curricula.
- Proposals to train “secret‑keeper” systems and analyses of PPO/GRPO’s human‑like interpretation aim to stress‑test safety and better understand reward‑shaped behavior.
- Synthetic data best practices: moderate rephrasing around 30% often helps; textbook‑style synthetic data tends not to—underscoring careful curation over sheer volume.
- Builders emphasized memory, proactive assistance, and thoughtful UX as the real differentiators for everyday AI utility, not parameter counts alone.
