## 💡 Discussions & Ideas
- Serving systems, I/O, and workflow design lag model capability; many deployments underutilize compute by orders of magnitude—an execution bottleneck, not just a model problem.
- Agentic AI debates shift toward context, tooling, and long‑horizon reliability. Studies show agents still stumble on extended tasks, pushing emphasis on memory and verification.
- AGI narratives intensified—“on the horizon” claims meet critiques of lab culture and underperformance. Researchers probe trillion‑token tasks and persistent AI VMs for durable autonomy.
- As most users can’t distinguish AI from human content, calls grow for zero‑trust access and rigorous identity controls for both agents and humans across enterprise systems.
- Practical reflections: do stacked coding tools really boost productivity? How to design LLM‑resistant interviews? Why traditional OCR fails on messy docs—arguing for structure‑aware extraction.
- Methodology debates continue: replacing weight decay with normalization to speed training, and multimodality bets (e.g., **MiniMax**) as a path to broader competence.
