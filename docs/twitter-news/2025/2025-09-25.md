Summary:
## News / Update
Industry momentum accelerated with Alibaba pushing a broad wave of Qwen3 releases and Scale AI launching the SEAL Showdown to spur fresh benchmarking. Hugging Face acquired Swift Jinja to strengthen developer tooling, and Figma integrated AllHands AI as an MCP client to streamline design-to-code translation in product workflows.

## New Tools
A wave of new agents and platforms landed. Google introduced a diffusion-based research-writing agent that drafts with adaptive reasoning. Ali TongyiLab released six open-source agentic systems (e.g., WebWeaver, AgentScaler), expanding what autonomous tools can do. Databricks launched Agent Bricks, packaging prompt- and training-time optimization methods (such as GEPA and SFT stacking) to lift open-source model performance. Ollama Cloud debuted to make deploying and using open models easier for teams. Apple unveiled SimpleFold, a Transformer-based protein folding system with open MLX models runnable on laptops, lowering the barrier to bio-AI experimentation. DeepEval arrived as a “Pytest for LLM apps,” simplifying evaluation across frameworks with lightweight test suites.

## LLMs
Coding and multimodal models advanced on several fronts. Meta released the 32B-parameter Code World Model as an open-weight research LLM for code generation, agentic reasoning, and planning, reporting strong results across benchmarks. Qwen3-VL set a new open-source bar for vision-language modeling using DeepStack techniques. Baichuan-M2 achieved state-of-the-art efficiency with an INT4 version trained via AutoRound. New composition methods like Core Space Merging enable near-lossless merging of LoRA adapters without restoring full weights, improving fine-tuning workflows. Coding-focused models are proliferating and being stress-tested: GPT-5-Codex is appearing in editors and evaluation platforms, while arenas now pit it against models like Qwen3-Coder-Plus on real web dev tasks. Research also highlighted that automated prompt optimization can push open-source models to match or surpass frontier systems on enterprise workloads at significantly lower cost.

## Features
Core developer tools gained meaningful upgrades. GitHub Copilot overhauled its embeddings and code search, delivering faster, more accurate results and detailing progress in its Copilot-Embedding model after months of improvements. Claude Code added slash-command chaining for more flexible, automated workflows. LangChain v1 introduced a versatile middleware API that supports planning, subagents, and human-in-the-loop patterns for complex pipelines. Ollama shipped an update improving local model performance and usability. Coding assistance is becoming more pervasive, with GPT-5-Codex integrations rolling into editors like VSCode for smarter in-IDE support.

## Discussions & Ideas
Global governance and research trajectories were in focus. An AI expert urged the UN Security Council to prevent concentration of AI capabilities and to coordinate internationally so access and benefits are broadly shared. While markets fixate on GPU buildouts and data centers, researchers emphasize that algorithmic advances—including quantum-inspired methods—may drive the next step change. Commentary also points to a near-term future where coding agents operate seamlessly across devices and surfaces, following developers from IDEs to the web, mobile, and even TVs.

## Showcases & Demos
Embodied AI made a leap with a generalist robot that assembles Lego models end-to-end from pixels alone, demonstrating precise, delicate manipulation without bespoke engineering—a strong signal of rapidly improving general-purpose robotic competence.
