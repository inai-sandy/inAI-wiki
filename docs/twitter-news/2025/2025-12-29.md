Summary:
## News / Update
Meta released the RPG dataset on Hugging Face to accelerate “AI co-scientist” research, bundling 22,000 structured research tasks with evaluation rubrics and reference solutions. Nvidia appointed Jonathan Ross as Chief Software Architect, reinforcing its push on advanced AI software. Industry highlights included Samsung’s first 2nm chip for next‑gen performance, Unitree’s acrobatic robots signaling rapid progress in low‑cost robotics, and MiniMax’s latest coding model upgrade. Academia is scaling up: Princeton is recruiting PhD talent to fuse 3D vision and generative AI for molecular and structural biology. Geopolitics and compliance remained in focus as reports surfaced of firms downplaying ties to China to evade restrictions. On the research front, a new Egocentric2Embodiment pipeline converts first‑person videos into structured QA to bridge perception and physical intelligence. The community also marked the birthday of early automation pioneer Leonardo Torres Quevedo.

## New Tools
New developer resources landed with LangChain’s interactive LLM inference visualizer, letting users see how prompts and context drive outputs in real time. Fresh model weights from A3B and 8B families are available on Hugging Face, inviting hands‑on experimentation with the latest training runs.

## LLMs
Open‑source momentum surged as GLM‑4.7 topped independent rankings, while roundups highlighted a wave of 2025 world models—LeJEPA, Dreamer 4, Genie 3, Cosmos WFM 2.5, Code World Model, and more—poised to reshape reasoning and control. Research spotlights include video models demonstrating strong zero‑shot task transfer, hinting at a coming step‑change for computer vision, and analysis of Qwen3’s “attention sink” behavior that allocates special processing to key tokens. Open‑source roadmaps feature Kimi K2, DeepSeek‑R1, GPT‑OSS, Qwen3, and GLM‑4.5. On hardware, MiniMax‑M2.1 showed impressive results on Apple’s M3 Ultra under MLX, underscoring rapidly improving local inference.

## Features
Performance and capability updates spanned the stack. A compact CuTe DSL kernel using TV layout beat Torch’s RMSNorm on B200 GPUs, showcasing how small, targeted kernels can deliver outsized gains. SonicMoE introduced IO‑aware and tile‑aware optimizations to streamline Mixture‑of‑Experts throughput. Agentic systems advanced with a “System 3” identity layer to align short‑term actions with long‑term goals, while OpenAI refreshed its agent kit with modular building blocks and Codex updates to simplify assembly and orchestration. Coding workflows improved with Codex’s Background Terminal for concurrent tasks and GLM‑4.7 integration in the Blackbox Agent CLI. On the media side, Kling 2.6 set a new bar for motion precision and stability in animation control. Infrastructure is catching up too: vLLM teased an MLX backend to accelerate inference on Apple hardware.

## Tutorials & Guides
A technical deep dive reviewed modern policy optimization beyond PPO—covering GRPO, DR.GRPO, GSPO, DAPO, and related variants—useful for researchers refining reinforcement learning pipelines. For broader context, Latent Space published end‑of‑year recaps on OpenAI’s Codex and GPT‑5 expectations, and a trio of interviews explored how AI and the Agentic web are reshaping the craft of software development.

## Showcases & Demos
AI‑driven storytelling and robotics took center stage. A behind‑the‑scenes AGI documentary drew massive viewership, while Diesol’s Rome‑set sequel “The Cleaner” pushed the boundaries of long‑form AI cinema with an original Emmy‑winner score. In robotics, DJ Reachy blended real‑time music generation with synchronized dance as an open‑source performance piece, and the compact Reachy Mini won praise as an approachable tabletop companion for makers and enthusiasts.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debate is intensifying around how AI changes work, research, and policy. Analyses of AI memory systems highlighted how storage and retrieval underpin agent reasoning. The ARC Prize win spotlighted disciplined non‑LLM approaches as a path to high‑quality breakthroughs, even as practitioners reported substantial productivity gains from today’s top coding models. Engineers described a transition from expert‑driven execution to agent‑orchestrated workflows, prompting questions about future roles—especially in testing—and raising the prospect of ultra‑lean teams building billion‑dollar companies. Commentators argued Claude Code could evolve into a mainstream “agent” experience, with evidence from its rapid adoption. Policy uncertainty loomed large: industry voices warned that fragmented state‑level rules could stifle creativity, while others argued for a uniform federal framework. Tax proposals—on billionaires and unrealized gains—sparked concern about distorting incentives for productive innovation. Historical context from academia underscored how neural nets moved from fringe to core, and several leaders predicted that 2026 will demand production‑grade results over flashy demos.
