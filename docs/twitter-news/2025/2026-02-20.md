Summary:
## News / Update
AI momentum spiked across industry, government, and healthcare. In India, OpenAI and Tata Group are partnering to build sovereign AI infrastructure to modernize enterprises and education, while Google and AIIMS Delhi are exploring clinician-facing AI tools to ease massive caseloads. Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai underscored responsible, large-scale collaboration at the India AI Action Summit. Temporal raised $300M to harden long-running AI agents with robust logging and automated recovery, and Anthropic is rapidly growing its Societal Impacts team to shape deployment and governance as its revenue growth trajectory accelerates ahead of OpenAI’s pace. Governments and public institutions are sharpening focus—evident from a new AI banner at the U.S. DOJ—while enterprise adoption is surging, with ChatGPT usage and token consumption skyrocketing. Robotics saw turbulence and rapid iteration, with headlines spanning Waymo’s remote-ops controversy, Amazon closing its Blue Jay effort, Tesla unveiling its first Cybercab, and Unitree planning large-scale humanoid deployment. New research and market perspectives dropped as well, including Mistral’s Voxtral Realtime technical report and a comprehensive “State of Generative Media” analysis on enterprise integration and where AI is headed next.

## New Tools
A wave of developer-first and agent-focused releases landed. TTSKit delivered open-source, on-device real-time TTS and voice cloning for Apple platforms, while Jina released compact, multilingual v5 embeddings for efficient edge use. Agent operations got easier with Southbridge’s open-sourced long-horizon runtime, Weaviate’s Agent Skills for quickly composing agent logic, and Trajectory Explorer to search, inspect, and understand agent decisions. LangChain’s OpenRouter integration unlocked 300+ models with tool-calling, structured outputs, and streaming, and Weights & Biases launched serverless supervised fine-tuning that autos-scales without GPU idle costs. GEPA’s “optimize_anything” API introduced a general-purpose text optimizer for domains like code, prompts, and policies, and ZeitZeuge emerged as an agentic performance engineer that profiles tests and auto-writes code-level fixes. OpenClaw proposed a transparent, Markdown-based workspace with a long-running gateway for memory and tool policies, LlamaAgent Builder enabled prompt-only document agents, and ZUNA open-sourced a 380M EEG foundation model for thought-to-text research.

## LLMs
Google’s Gemini 3.1 Pro dominated model news, more than doubling prior zero-shot reasoning on ARC-AGI-2 (around 77%) and posting major gains in coding, math, and instruction following versus Gemini 3 Pro. The model touts a giant context window, reductions in hallucinations, broad availability across Google platforms, and lower costs. Early enterprise rollouts include Perplexity, where it quickly became a top choice behind Claude 4.5. Beyond Gemini, competitive activity remained intense: Anthropic’s Sonnet-4.6 led creative and long-form writing benchmarks with Opus 4.6 close behind; Trinity Large (Arcee AI) entered open-model contests; and Unsloth’s GGUF quantizations preserved near-original accuracy on Qwen3.5-397B-A17B for more efficient deployment. Research advances targeted reasoning and efficiency: DeepMind’s Aletheia reframed LLMs as autonomous math researchers, new attention with long KV caches and sparse lookup extended memory at near-linear cost, MICE sped up re-ranking by stripping extra attention, ColBERT-Zero achieved state-of-the-art retrieval on BEIR using only public data, and InftyThink+ trained models to pause and review reasoning with trajectory-level RL. Transparency improved as a previously private benchmark from the Michelangelo paper was opened to the public.

## Features
Popular AI products shipped meaningful upgrades that cut friction and expand capability. ChatGPT added fully interactive code blocks for writing, editing, and previewing apps and diagrams in-chat, bundled Codex access into standard subscriptions, and introduced automatic prompt caching to simplify performance optimizations. Fine-tuning also got easier with prompt-only customization flows that require no code or GPUs. Perplexity upgraded both consumer and enterprise tiers with Gemini 3.1 Pro and added Finance features that deep-link directly to relevant pages in SEC filings for faster, auditable research. Google Labs’ Pomelli launched a “Photoshoot” capability that turns a single product image into high-quality marketing shots, free in select countries. LangSmith’s Agent Builder now learns from feedback, uses specialized skills for richer context, and supports in-place instruction edits—paired with cleaner trace filtering—to help teams debug and iterate faster.

## Tutorials & Guides
Practical guidance focused on squeezing more from agents and making evaluations clearer. A new guide on prompt caching shows how to extend agent horizons and stay within context limits. Separately, a walkthrough of Arena’s expert and occupational leaderboards helps users interpret ranking methodologies and compare model strengths across real-world tasks.

## Showcases & Demos
Demonstrations highlighted how far agentic systems and model-driven tooling have come. Anthropic showed an AI-generated C compiler constructed with Claude, sparking debate but underscoring rapid progress in complex software synthesis. In production environments, Ramp’s agent now authors roughly half of merged PRs by auto-spinning isolated dev environments and running large numbers of sessions in parallel. Automated performance engineering is maturing too: new tools read V8 CPU profiles and ZeitZeuge ties directly into unit tests to diagnose bottlenecks and propose code-level fixes. On the data side, a full re-OCR of the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica for about $5 using GLM-OCR on Hugging Face Jobs showcased drastic cost compression for large-scale digitization.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debate centered on why AI hasn’t yet transformed the macroeconomy: leaders like Anthropic’s Dario Amodei pointed to bottlenecks beyond raw model capability, while others argued the decisive factors are robust ecosystems, modular tooling, and production-grade infrastructure. A new “harness engineer” role is emerging to wrap, steer, and safeguard agents. Multiple posts warned about reliability and security: LLMs can attempt unauthorized tool calls, today’s AI still struggles with secure coding and patching, identity systems weren’t built for autonomous agents, and critical decisions require human verification. Research on disclosure is mixed—labeling AI authorship can shape trust perceptions, but tagging arguments as AI-made doesn’t necessarily reduce their persuasiveness. Studies also showed humans, even “super-recognizers,” struggle to spot deepfakes. Technical insights emphasized smarter trade-offs: deeper “reasoning” settings can hurt quality and inflate costs, data curation can deliver order-of-magnitude efficiency gains, and high-quality multilingual data need not dilute English performance. Broader context traced the shift from ConvNets to Transformers in vision, explored DSPy’s potential to unlock more capable personal assistants, and noted Sam Altman’s bold timeline for superintelligence by 2028.

## Memes & Humor
A tongue-in-cheek hiring tactic made waves: an interview “taboo word” that auto-rejects candidates who repeat it too often—a playful critique of gimmicky filters that sparked plenty of commentary about how to test genuine reasoning.
