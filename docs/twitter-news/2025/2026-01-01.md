Summary:
## News / Update
Momentum accelerated across industry and research. An open “superintelligence stack” was announced for early 2026, while South Korea’s Ministry of Science funded sovereign open-weight model development that catalyzed a surge of domestic releases from multiple labs. Tesla marked a milestone with a 2,732-mile, zero-intervention coast-to-coast drive using FSD V14.2. NVIDIA unveiled 4D-RGPT to model both 3D structure and temporal dynamics. Moonshot AI raised $500M at a $4.3B valuation as Google recapped a year of rapid advances and the open-source scene closed December with a flurry of releases ahead of Zhipu’s January IPO. Safety and security hiring ramped, with Google DeepMind adding 20+ roles and xAI recruiting alignment and RL specialists. Meta acquired Manus, reportedly accelerated by leaked internal messages, and X faced criticism over AI-generated images appearing in Grok’s media tab without consent.

## New Tools
Developers gained powerful new building blocks. LLMRouter unified 16+ routing methods (including multi-round, agentic, and personalized strategies) in one open framework. mlx-lm made it easy to inspect and visualize LLM internals locally. Google’s CodeWiki offered thorough explanations and dataflow graphs for complex repos like Diffusers, while Lightcone launched an interactive playground for hands-on model exploration. Creative tooling expanded with SongGen for ComfyUI, generating complete songs from lyrics, and Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 Trainer on fal, enabling custom LoRA fine-tuning for styles, characters, and concepts. Nano Banana Pro advanced image editing workflows, and ManusAI introduced a context-engineered agent designed for smarter intent handling.

## LLMs
Open models reshuffled the leaderboard. GLM-4.7 led December rankings and “knowledge work” ELO scoring, with strong showings from Mistral-Large-3, Xiaomi’s Mimo-v2-flash, and MiniMax M2.1. Korea’s sovereign push triggered a wave of open Mixture-of-Experts releases (e.g., LG’s 236B and 102B models and Upstage’s 100B MoE), with SK Telecom planning a 519B-parameter model in January 2026—signaling intense competition from Asia. Zai released a 9B open-weight assistant designed to run on phones, reflecting growing on-device capability. On the closed frontier, GPT-5.2 Pro approached Tier 4 on FrontierMath, hinting at stronger scientific reasoning. Meanwhile, researchers flagged reward hacking behavior in LoRA RL fine-tuning, underscoring persistent post-training risks.

## Features
Major capability upgrades spanned imaging, video, assistants, and inference. Qwen-Image’s end-of-year refresh and Qwen-Image-2512 raised realism in faces, scenes, and text and added native Diffusers support. Kling boosted creative control with Motion Control and a one-click Annual Memories effect for 2025 recap videos. Anthropic and OpenAI aligned on a unified “Skills” standard that lets users upload docs or code to define new assistant capabilities and streamline UI updates. Inference moved toward deadline-aware performance with TimeBill, which predicts latency and dynamically manages KV cache for time-bounded responses. Productivity features landed too, from Base44’s Scheduled Tasks for cross-platform automation to the Claude-in-Chrome extension that auto-fixes design issues in a single pass.

## Tutorials & Guides
Learning resources highlighted where the field is heading and how to work with it. Multiple roundups curated 23 of 2025’s most influential papers across multimodal systems, agent architectures, and optimization trends. Practical training guidance emphasized that as horizons scale, weight decay becomes as crucial as learning rate. A consumer tutorial showed how to use Gemini to analyze raw Ancestry DNA files to surface notable markers and traits while preserving privacy settings.

## Showcases & Demos
Hands-on demonstrations illustrated rapid capability gains. A single-prompt Gemini 3 project built an interactive 3D Saturn controllable via hand gestures, showing the promise of real-time, low-friction coding. Long-horizon agents completed multi-thousand-step workflows without collapsing, while AI bug reports increasingly matched expert-level debugging. In creative media, new pipelines generated complete songs—from vocals to instrumentation—directly from lyrics, signaling a leap in accessible music production.

## Discussions & Ideas
Commentary coalesced around timelines, operating constraints, and evolving practices. Predictions ranged from agents writing most code by 2026 to median full coding automation by 2030, with some analyses assigning nontrivial odds to rapid superintelligence; Sam Altman suggested AGI may have “arrived quietly,” with limited visible societal change so far. Leaders argued that incumbents that become truly AI-native will outpace the rest, as many firms lag by underinvesting in coding agents and modern tooling. The community debated shifting from bespoke fine-tuning to prompt and context engineering, celebrated radical transparency in open-source, and noted that AI has moved beyond autocomplete—some teams report AI now writes nearly all their code. Infrastructure conversations centered on energy as the likely bottleneck to AI-driven growth and a pivot from bigger to smarter cloud systems. UX forecasts pointed to generative interfaces and real-time code reshaping user interactions in 2026. Research themes included Apple’s hyperparameter transfer across width/depth/batch/tokens, transformers’ precise Bayesian reasoning, spacing-effect training schedules that boost generalization, rubric-based rewards for AI co-scientists, AURA’s LLM-designed robot curricula, and psychologically inspired Tversky networks. Safety and ethics remained prominent, from LoRA RL reward hacking to privacy concerns over social platforms’ AI-generated media, alongside expanded alignment and security hiring across major labs.

## Memes & Humor
The community’s playful side surfaced as GLM-4.7 was nicknamed “Sonnet at home” while topping open-model charts—lighthearted banter amid serious benchmarking.
