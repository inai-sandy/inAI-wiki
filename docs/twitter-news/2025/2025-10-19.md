Summary:
## News / Update
Hardware, platforms, and partnerships dominated the week. NVIDIA crossed a $4 trillion market cap as reviewers noted Blackwell GPUs diverge sharply from prior series, while the company confirmed it has effectively ceded China—accelerating adoption of domestic accelerators there. OpenAI is co-developing custom data-center chips with Broadcom to diversify beyond NVIDIA. Google pushed a broad wave of releases, including Veo 3.1, a unified AI playground, and live Google Maps grounding inside the Gemini API. Runway launched Apps and new models exposed via API, capped by a community showcase. Open-source infrastructure advanced as the vLLM project attracted new sponsorship. Sora’s second major update landed. The graph community announced NODES 2025, a free global online event for graph + AI developers. Trends also pointed to surging document AI interest as OCR-centric models topped Hugging Face rankings. On the methods front, NVIDIA introduced QeRL, blending quantization, low‑rank adaptation, and adaptive noise to make reinforcement learning faster and cheaper.

## New Tools
A steady stream of developer-facing tools arrived. LlamaIndex released an open-source Workflow Debugger to run, trace, and visualize multi-agent systems with human-in-the-loop control. A new open-source platform for LLM app evaluation and monitoring added tracing, automated evals, and real-time dashboards for agents and RAG. Event Deep Research can extract and normalize biographical timelines from multiple sources into structured JSON. Chandra OCR launched on Datalab API with strong performance on messy handwriting and forms, multi-language support, and plans to open source. xAI’s Grok Imagine 0.9 Hyperrealism v1.0 debuted with notable visual and audio quality improvements and is free to try.

## LLMs
Vision–language and efficiency advances stood out alongside sobering capability checks. Alibaba’s Qwen 3 VL now runs on iPhone 17 Pro with competitive OCR and visual understanding on-device. Baidu’s PaddleOCR VL (≈0.9B params) targets 109 languages with a NaViT + ERNIE-4.5 design and sets new marks on document analysis benchmarks like OmniDocBench. The Gauntlet benchmark gained traction as a cross-scale standard for base-model evaluation, while GLM 4.6 posted top throughput on Baseten’s Cline platform. New decoding research included Elastic-Cache to accelerate diffusion-based LLMs without quality loss and Context-Folding for agents to compress/branch context, beating ReAct with 10× lower memory. Findings on speculative decoding showed speed-ups are uneven across languages and tasks, and ICCV results revealed top VLMs surprisingly struggle with simple visual anomaly detection. LLM limits remained evident: even with unlimited retries, hardest math benchmarks stay below 50% accuracy; at the same time, roadmaps hint GPT-5 in 2025 with massive context, multimodality, and stronger reasoning. NeurIPS-accepted “general‑reasoner” explored extracting QA from pretraining data for RL, and SR‑Scientist showcased autonomous equation discovery with tool-augmented LLMs.

## Features
Local and enterprise workflows got easier and faster. llama.cpp’s new local UI via llama-server turns desktops into straightforward personal LLM labs. Keras added one-line quantization for int4/int8/float8/GPTQ across your own and KerasHub models, simplifying deployment and research. LangGraph integrated cognee for persistent agent memory across sessions. Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast unlocked advanced tool and agent capabilities for end users. Gemini improved LaTeX authoring with better rendering, inline edits, and direct download. Golden Gate Claude returned with much stronger personality steering via new Skills. A unified, agent-powered web development experience rolled out, tying research, site creation, and analysis under one architecture. METR Evals refreshed its Notes interface to emphasize “work in progress” status for early findings.

## Tutorials & Guides
Hands-on learning resources proliferated. Hugging Face published a comprehensive robot learning tutorial spanning RL, behavioral cloning, and language-conditioned control, with pointers to emerging “generalist” robot models. New work on LLM-powered code synthesis for symbolic world models illustrates how agents can learn and plan efficiently in complex multi-agent environments. Universities including Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSD released timely ML systems courses, keeping students aligned with the latest advances via open materials.

## Showcases & Demos
Applied demos highlighted rapid production and surprising capabilities. Creators used Google’s Veo 3.1 to produce a polished, cinematic explainer in a single day with precise camera continuity using frame references. Grok 4 Heavy identified a missing step in a 1995 proof and validated it numerically. Claude generated sophisticated PDF visuals and flipbooks purely with code. A public playground let users compare SWE‑grep against Claude Code side by side. Runway spotlighted community work featuring Sway Molina. New image-generation techniques drew attention: WithAnyone enabled controllable, identity-consistent outputs, while RepTok demonstrated full-image synthesis from a single continuous latent token. On the practical side, a costed setup showed a 32B VLM/OCR can run on a single RTX 6000 at about $1/hour.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debates centered on integrity, capability realism, and the future of work. Privacy advocates warned that assistant-in-the-loop experiences can undermine true end‑to‑end encryption. Multiple analyses showed academia now dominates ML conference authorship and publication growth as industry participation wanes. Andrej Karpathy urged realism—calling most current agents “slop,” arguing we’re training “ghosts, not animals,” and suggesting AGI may still be a decade away—while Elon Musk put a 10% and rising probability on Grok 5 reaching AGI. Concerns mounted that continual pretraining on low-quality, engagement-optimized web data can cause lasting “brain rot” in LLMs. Research culture took heat after a viral AGI paper was caught with fake citations and claims that ChatGPT solved Erdős problems were traced to simple web lookups. Hiring norms are shifting toward live, AI-powered skills demonstrations over resumes. Hardware discourse questioned longstanding assumptions about pro GPU performance gaps amid rapid generational changes. Conceptual work probed what representations diffusion models learn, and agent researchers argued that accumulating skills isn’t sufficient—true continual learning will require automaticity to free attention for harder tasks.
