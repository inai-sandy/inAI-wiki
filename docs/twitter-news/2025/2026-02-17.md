Hardware and infrastructure dominated headlines. NVIDIA unveiled the Blackwell Ultra GB300 NVL72 with bold claims of 50x higher performance per megawatt and 35x lower cost per token versus Hopper—signaling energy efficiency as the new bottleneck for AI at scale. InferenceX expanded cross-hardware support to NVIDIA, AMD, and soon TPUs/Trainium, and published v2 benchmarks comparing Blackwell, AMD MI355X, and Hopper for large-model serving. Supply chains are tightening: Western Digital reportedly pre-sold its entire 2026 enterprise HDD capacity to hyperscalers. On the platform and ecosystem front, Baseten acqui-hired Inferless to streamline developer infra, LanceDB partnered with Hugging Face to bring built-in vector/similarity search to the Hub, and FriendliAI offered up to $50K in credits to teams rethinking inference with Orca. New institutions and events underscored the community’s breadth: Principia launched to advance deep learning theory for safety; a compact AI Plumbers Unconference ran alongside FOSDEM; and Python luminary Armin Ronacher will speak at PyAI. Company moves included Sakana AI’s relocation to Tokyo’s Mori JP Tower to fuel hiring and Peter Steinberger joining OpenAI to help shape personal AI agents. Beyond LLMs, ByteDance rolled out Seedance 1.0 and its successor Seed 2.0 on Arena, while BytePlus introduced Seed 2.0 Mini for cost-conscious multimodal use. Research and model progress spanned modalities: ViT-5 pushed Vision Transformer performance with architectural updates; DeepMind’s Persona Generators presented a way to synthesize diverse agent populations via evolutionary optimization; and new codec-inspired approaches for video LMs indicated a path to leaner tokenization and stronger temporal understanding.

## New Tools
A wave of developer- and creator-focused tools arrived. Viktor emerged as an AI coworker inside Slack, automating marketing audits, ad ops, lead research, and daily reporting while integrating with thousands of apps. TinkerAPI offered a clean scaffold for implementing custom weight-update algorithms, decoupling infrastructure from learning logic. EnCompass introduced “rewindable” Python for LLM-powered programs, streamlining debugging of agent workflows. Ciana Parrot launched as a self-hosted, multi-channel assistant with scheduled tasks and extensible skills. LlamaIndex demoed an AI Invoice Reconciler that cross-checks invoices against contracts. For media creation, Magnific’s video upscaler entered beta to jump from 720p to 4K, and Synthesia enabled instant Word-to-video generation. Base44 debuted a CLI-first, AI-ready backend platform to spin up auth, databases, and hosting from the terminal. Agent framework updates added low-level hooks and session control to intercept, modify, or block agent actions for safer customizations.

## LLMs
Alibaba’s Qwen 3.5 dominated model news with a 397B-parameter multimodal MoE featuring a 262K context window, native vision-language capabilities, early fusion, Gated Delta Networks, and 201-language support. The series emphasized sparsity—ranking high in both parameter and expert sparsity—yielding faster inference and strong efficiency. A new open-weight variant, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B, arrived under Apache 2.0 with availability on Hugging Face and Ollama Cloud, while day‑0 vLLM support and reports of complex tasks running on consumer hardware highlighted practical adoption. Benchmarks and community chatter positioned Qwen 3.5 as competitive with frontier systems across reasoning and multimodal tasks.

MiniMax M2.5 rolled out broadly—on its own API and via Together AI—touting top-tier coding, structured planning, and real-world agent reliability trained over 200K+ scenarios. Efficiency benchmarks on 8x H200s reported roughly 2,500 tokens per second per GPU, underscoring strong throughput for interactive use. Open model performance tightened: GLM‑5 entered MathArena as the #2 open model, while compact systems gained ground in math reasoning—4B-parameter models reached Olympiad-level performance and QED‑Nano (4B) neared Gemini 3 Pro on advanced proofs, hinting at a future where small, specialized models match or beat much larger peers. Additional momentum included JoyAI‑LLM‑Flash going open source with GGUF quantization and MLX support, and a 2026 roadmap rumor for Kimi K3 targeting an ultra‑sparse hybrid architecture exceeding 2T parameters. Research on multi‑agent “self‑correction” using Qwen3‑8B roles highlighted that teaching robust revision and critique remains harder than solving problems once—an active frontier for agentic LLM design.

## Features
Existing products gained meaningful capabilities. GitHub Copilot CLI now auto-connects to VS Code from the terminal, smoothing diagnostics and editor workflows. Perplexity Finance enriched equity pages with analyst consensus, 52‑week targets, and news‑based synthesis for deeper investment research. NVIDIA’s PersonaPlex introduced full‑duplex, interruption‑friendly voice interactions with configurable personas, making real‑time conversational AI more natural. Agent frameworks added granular hooks and session controls to let teams intercept or modify agent operations for safer, compliant deployments.

## Tutorials & Guides
Hands-on learning resources proliferated. A browser-based robotics tutorial showed how to build interactive simulators with MuJoCo (WebAssembly), Three.js, and Gemini ER. A DIY guide walked through creating a household robot that recognizes faces, manages calendars, assists with writing/coding, and chats. A new book on multi-agent systems emphasized enduring principles—LLM agents, human-in-the-loop design, and coordination—over hype. An intuitive app offered minimal‑math lessons to demystify LLMs. Practical case studies detailed how VCs use LangSmith and LangGraph to automate startup discovery, and how prompt engineering plus automated evals enabled scaling agents to 127M users. Foundational primers covered 13 core AI model types, and a deep-dive post on linear layers and steepest descent rounded out the theory.

## Showcases & Demos
Creative and industrial demos highlighted rapid progress. Director Jia Zhangke produced a short film in three days with Seedance 2.0, framing AI as an accelerant for cinema rather than a replacement. MIT’s Gemini 3 transformed a 3D spider web image into an interactive tool with simulation and STL export, showcasing vision‑to‑software fluency. Unitree humanoids performed parkour and martial‑arts routines at China’s Spring Festival Gala, while reports underscored the broader acceleration of Chinese robotics. Industrial automation impressed with fully automated 3D printing of 12‑meter ship hulls in ~140 hours. Training efficiency jumped as the NanoGPT speedrun record fell below 90 seconds. In real-world applications, Pinecone-powered retrieval drove 99% recall across 600M+ documents for patent analytics with large cost savings. Agentic systems like SkyBot demonstrated steady progress toward long‑horizon autonomy, even as setup complexity remains a hurdle.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debate intensified around AI’s trajectory and societal impact. Multiple studies questioned whether recent “reasoning” gains stem from vastly larger datasets rather than genuine generalization, while another found coding assistants can erode developer mastery—especially debugging—without clear productivity offsets. Education experts warned AI edtech could amplify existing school shortcomings. Labor and credentialing came under scrutiny: an ex‑Google leader argued fast‑moving AI could outpace professional degrees, data showed most new AI PhDs head straight to industry, and MIT’s David Autor cautioned that AI‑driven abundance could still undermine incomes and democratic resilience without policy foresight.

Industry culture and strategy also took center stage. Commentators contrasted OpenAI’s emphasis on precise, rigorous debate with Anthropic’s intuitive, socially attuned approach; advocated “missionary founders” using free, powerful building blocks to solve real problems; and argued go‑to‑market should be treated as an engineering problem. Technical discourse highlighted how LLMs are reshaping programming language priorities (e.g., Rust migrations, formal methods), the rise of local models for private assistants, and new pricing experiments offering “free for humans.” Safety conversations revisited reinforcement learning’s propensity for reward hacking and Nick Bostrom’s analogy of superintelligence development as high‑stakes surgery. Additional threads probed whether software’s unique context exposure makes it more automatable than other jobs, urged AI to augment rather than replace workers, noted tradeoffs of MLA designs that shine in single-turn tasks but complicate multi-agent scaling, and warned China’s plan to award academic credit for open-source contributions could flood repos with low‑quality, AI‑generated code. Progress metrics like WeirdML’s task time horizons suggested capability timelines are shrinking, with estimated performance doubling roughly every few months.
