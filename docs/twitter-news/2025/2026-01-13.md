## News / Update
OpenAI moved deeper into digital health by acquiring Torch to enrich ChatGPT Health with unified labs, meds, and visit data. Apple struck a multi‑year deal to use Google’s Gemini to power next‑gen Siri and Apple Intelligence, while Google and Shopify unveiled the Universal Commerce Protocol and in‑search checkout to enable agent‑driven shopping across major retailers. The UK government pledged a crackdown on non‑consensual sexual deepfakes. On the infrastructure front, Nvidia tightened restrictions on custom components in VR200 server trays, and a CoreWeave executive outlined how their cloud differentiates for AI-scale workloads. The open-source and research ecosystem stayed active: GLM‑4.7 became accessible via Hugging Face with Cerebras; Devstral 2 models were opened for free use; FineTranslations released a trillion‑token English parallel corpus from FineWeb2; ML Collective Africa launched with a 2026 kickoff; ICML 2026 introduced author self‑ranking; and a new OpenEnv competition with PyTorch, UnslothAI, and AgentBeats offered $10K for agentic RL. Market and community headlines included divergent IPO receptions for Zhipu AI and MiniMax, a standout open‑source AI conference drawing leaders from Zhipu, Kimi, and Qwen, and Synthesia’s CEO detailing the technical and business realities of “digital twin” video avatars. Google’s Gemini Nano Banana Pro crossed 1 billion images generated in 53 days, underscoring rapid generative adoption.

## New Tools
A wave of agentic and domain‑specific tools arrived. Ramp’s in‑house async coding agent (Tryramp “Inspect”) now authors about 30% of merged code, signaling practical maturity for autonomous dev assistants. DTAgent‑AD targets biomedical and neurodegenerative research with a specialized reasoning agent, while moPPIt generates motif‑specific protein binders in seconds with experimental validation. Apple’s GenCtrl gives developers formal control knobs for creative generative models. AnyDepth streamlines accurate depth estimation for broader developer access. New open‑source utilities include a full‑stack LLM evaluation and tracing platform, a lightning‑fast Rust browser‑automation CLI for agents, and Nanocode—a tiny, dependency‑free Claude coding agent in ~250 lines. A “Deep Research Agent” composes subagents atop MiniMax M2.1 and a droid CLI for complex research workflows. Breakthrough transcription tooling demonstrated near‑real‑time conversion of an hour‑long, multi‑gigabyte video in roughly 80 seconds.

## LLMs
Benchmarks and capabilities advanced on multiple fronts. Zhipu’s GLM‑4.7 launched on Together AI and topped LMArena’s Code Arena with a 200K context and agentic tooling, while Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Opus took the lead on the SWE‑fficiency code‑agent benchmark. An Aleph agent using OpenAI’s GPT‑5.2 hit a record 99.4% on PutnamBench, even detecting misformalizations. Long‑context and memory research accelerated: DeepSeek’s Engram reintroduces hashed N‑gram memory with O(1) lookups; removing positional embeddings post‑pretraining with a brief recalibration markedly improves long‑context generalization; Recursive Language Models split and aggregate content to handle million‑token prompts; and new fast‑weight product‑key memory and efficient agent‑memory schemes boost recall and stability. Multiple efforts—Stanford’s TTT‑E2E and Nvidia’s end‑to‑end test‑time training—show models can keep learning from live context after deployment by compressing information into weights. Efficiency and scaling methods progressed with Nvidia’s NVFP4 enabling stable 4‑bit training for scientific world models, NanoGPT kernel‑fusion speedups via Triton, and sparse‑attention layers preserving performance in long‑sequence models. Studies also flagged pitfalls like over‑searching in retrieval‑augmented systems and introduced techniques such as Verbalized Sampling to reduce mode collapse. Beyond text, JEPA‑style world models were highlighted for robotics planning. Trends included evidence that smaller LMs can outperform larger ones inside multi‑agent systems, growing adoption of tools like Muon for ablations, targeted funding into human‑like memory (Astera), and hardware guidance from Google on alleviating memory/network bottlenecks in inference.

## Features
Major platforms expanded practical capabilities. Anthropic introduced Cowork—an approachable layer on top of Claude Code—to bring agentic workflows to non‑developers. Reports highlight Claude Code’s real‑browser execution, checkpointed progress to local files, and SDK support for building personal assistants; simple Bash scripting is enabling rich agent behaviors with low context overhead. In healthcare, Claude added new connectors and Agent Skills to better integrate with life sciences workflows. Google’s Gemini API now supports direct file access from Google Cloud Storage and signed URLs across providers with uploads up to 2GB, easing large‑file AI pipelines. Google also rolled out in‑search checkout tied to the Universal Commerce Protocol, connecting with the Gemini app for agent‑powered shopping. Developer performance got boosts as SGLang began accelerating any Diffusers pipeline, LTX‑2 achieved video stretching with pitch‑perfect audio sync, and Kling 2.6’s Motion Brush improved precise motion control from a single image. GitHub Copilot broadened login options to increase access, Grok Imagine added popular aspect ratios for image and video generation, and Hugging Face integrated GLM‑4.7 and “chat with papers” in HuggingChat.

## Tutorials & Guides
Fresh learning resources emphasized practical building blocks. Stanford’s updated CS224N added material on agents, tool use, and reasoning, while roundups showcased the week’s most impactful research. Practitioners shared “12 must‑know” fine‑tuning methods from LoRA to RLHF, and guidance on prompt caching as a straightforward lever to cut LLM costs without degrading quality. Playbooks stressed the core ingredients for strong agents—data, context, and trace analysis—alongside emerging practices for inspecting an agent’s intermediate reasoning to debug failures. Career advice reinforced that demonstrable projects outweigh credentials for landing AI roles.

## Showcases & Demos
Creative and technical demos showed AI’s expanding reach. Mortar prototypes games by inventing novel mechanics as first‑class building blocks, highlighting human‑AI co‑creation in design. A prize‑winning web app converts 2D topographic maps into vivid 3D flythroughs with live Gemini‑powered terrain explanations. AI‑generated anime videos compressed complex history—such as the Iranian revolution—into striking summaries. In applied healthcare and creative tooling, Claude spun MRI data on a USB drive into a complete HTML viewer and powered prompt‑driven control of Blender for 3D modeling. Visual generation highlights included impressive motion‑controlled dances from a single image using Kling 2.6’s Motion Brush.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debates centered on governance, evaluation, and product philosophy. An AI‑generated op‑ed published by The Hill reignited concerns over editorial oversight and transparency in newsrooms. Experts argued that Likert‑scale annotation is ill‑suited for LLM evaluation, encouraging richer, more decisive feedback mechanisms. Builders advocated for “opinionated” agents—clear defaults and sharper choices—to reduce indecision and improve UX, and for tracing decision paths (adopted by teams like Anthropic and LangChain) to enhance safety and debuggability. Commentators predicted 2026 as a breakthrough year for AI‑driven science and suggested that knowing “what to build” may matter more than hand‑coding skills as automation rises. Broader societal concerns included the expanding use of AI‑enabled surveillance and indications of homogenized social feeds that could amplify propaganda, alongside ongoing debates about post‑deployment learning and its safety implications.
