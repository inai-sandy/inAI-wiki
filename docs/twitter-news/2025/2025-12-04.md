Summary:
## News / Update
Industry momentum accelerated across funding, policy, and deployments. Phind raised $10.4M to reimagine search as interactive mini‑apps, while Ricursive secured $35M to apply AI to chip design. Klay Vision became the first AI music company licensed by Sony, Universal, and Warner, signaling a new path for legally remixing existing hits. OpenAI awarded $40.5M to 208 nonprofits in its People‑First AI Fund, and a new Foundation Models Transparency Index pushed for higher standards of openness beyond just model release. Waymo expanded into four new cities and began fully driverless operations in Dallas, and Groq reported 2.5 million developers, a new Sydney data center, and fresh global partnerships. AWS Bedrock added 18 open-source models to its enterprise catalog, broadening OSS access for businesses. Research showcases at NeurIPS highlighted new work from EleutherAI, Sakana AI, and Google (including Gemini and SIMA 2), with active hiring from MiniMax and Genentech. The first production‑ready vLLM plugin for Intel Gaudi arrived, and Apple proposed STARFlow‑V to address limitations in video diffusion models.

## New Tools
A wave of creative and agentic tools hit users’ hands. Phind 3 turned answers into interactive mini‑apps for hands‑on search. Meta’s SAM‑3 unified image, video, and object segmentation in a single system, while ByteDance’s Seedream 4.5 improved image editing, typography, and fidelity. Video creation advanced with Kling 2.6 adding native, synchronized audio for fully voiced outputs, BlockVid producing minute‑long consistent clips, Runway Gen‑4.5 boosting photorealism and artistic range, and ViSAudio enabling immersive binaural audio generation aligned to video. Agent creation got simpler with Google’s Workspace Studio (no‑code custom agents), LlamaCloud’s one‑click agent deployments, and an Agentic Reviewer designed to accelerate academic peer feedback. Automotive AI saw AutoNeural‑VL‑1.5B run locally and in real time on Qualcomm NPUs. On the open side, NVIDIA’s ToolScale dataset surged on Hugging Face, and the open visual retriever EvoQwen2.5‑VL outperformed strong baselines on ViDoRe v2 and is cleared for commercial use.

## LLMs
Model capability and evaluation continued to intensify. Claude Opus 4.5 set new marks by solving CORE‑Bench for scientific reproducibility and topping Vending‑Bench Arena, while a medical model, Glass 4.0, surpassed GPT‑5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 and even generalist physicians on the NOHARM benchmark. New entrants like INTELLECT‑3 (a 106B MoE) opened for public Arena testing, and DeepSeek V3.2 challenged leaders with top‑tier open weights and efficiency innovations; Minimax M2 retained the lead on SWE‑Bench for open models as DeepSeek pushed aggressive pricing. Amazon’s Nova 2.0 family emphasized stronger agentic behavior, and rumors pointed to Mistral 3/14B returns with vision and multilingual gains. Research on “confession” training for GPT‑5 aimed to improve self‑assessment and transparency, with separate claims of GPT‑5.1 discovering a novel mathematical property. Automated proof systems continued to approach and sometimes exceed strong human baselines, underscoring rapid gains in reasoning‑heavy tasks.

## Features
Developer and workflow capabilities saw major upgrades. Claude Opus 4.5 became selectable in Claude Code terminals for advanced coding. LangChain introduced block‑level cache control for agents, shipped a no‑code builder for automated Slack briefings, and showcased deeper multi‑agent orchestration via its open‑source harness. LangSmith’s Agent Builder powered thousands of real‑world workflows like research synthesis and issue tracking. Prompt optimization matured as Stanford’s DSPy integrated with Weave for in‑code optimization and with mlflow for prompt versioning and evaluation. Infrastructure performance climbed with SuffixDecoding in vLLM, a production‑ready vLLM plugin for Intel Gaudi, and Mistral 3 models landing in llama.cpp. Hugging Face enabled near‑instant dataset duplication—even at 1TB scale—via Xet. For creative pipelines, Synthesia integrated Gemini 3 Pro Image to provide instant image generation, while Nano Banana Pro added 2K/4K API support. Coding search improved through multi‑vector architectures that cut token overhead and raise retrieval accuracy.

## Tutorials & Guides
Resources focused on practical skill‑building and evaluation literacy. A comprehensive 200‑page survey mapped the landscape of code foundation models and program synthesis. Step‑by‑step materials showed how to build a fully functional AI agent in pure Python and how to create coding agents that safely execute their own code. The LLM Evaluation Guidebook v2 offered beginner‑friendly, hands‑on guidance for robust model assessment. Concept refreshers revisited the bias‑variance tradeoff and its subtleties, sharpening intuition for modeling and diagnostics.

## Showcases & Demos
Creative demos highlighted how quickly AI media tools are maturing. Kling’s latest models delivered fast, high‑quality videos with synchronized dialogue, music, and effects and showcased cinematic framing. Runway’s Gen‑4.5 produced richly lit, realistic imagery with minimal prompting. Moondream’s segmentation handled cluttered, real‑world scenes with unusually precise object boundaries, indicating stronger scene understanding in practical settings. Synthesia’s trajectory underscored how far AI video production has come in just two years.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debate centered on research culture, evaluation, and where progress is coming from. Michael I. Jordan cautioned that “superintelligence vs. extinction” rhetoric can deter young researchers. Evidence that decentralized systems can outperform centralized ones challenged architectural assumptions, while “harness engineering” was credited for many of the biggest agent advances since 2023. Researchers probed mismatches between training and inference in RL, argued for stitched and prompt‑optimized benchmarks, and called for stronger testing infrastructure as AI‑generated code becomes standard. Multi‑agent communication remains a key bottleneck. Fresh paradigms surfaced, including nested learning, chain‑of‑visual‑thought for VLMs, prompt trees for dramatic speedups on structured data, and faster distillation via Flash‑DMD. Historical context resurfaced with Fukushima’s 1986 CNN precursor, prompting reflection on the scaling race and what exactly is being scaled. Deep learning made headway on long‑stubborn tabular tasks, and weekly digests highlighted advances in RL, sparse attention, reasoning, and multi‑agent collaboration. Commentary also emphasized the outsized impact of indie builders, forecast a post‑exit deep‑tech founder wave, and pointed to grocery delivery as a proving ground for applied ML, robotics, and logistics.
