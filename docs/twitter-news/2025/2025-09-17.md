Summary:
## News / Update
A flurry of industry moves and milestones defined the week. TikTok’s U.S. operations will shift to 80% ownership by Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz, while Atlassian acquired The Browser Company for $610 million to bolster AI-native productivity. Microsoft committed $30 billion to the UK over four years, and Figure Robotics surpassed $1 billion in funding at a $39 billion valuation; Cognition, creator of Devin, reached a $10 billion valuation in under two years. On mobility, Waymo won approval to operate at San Francisco International Airport and published 96 million miles of safety data. Platform momentum was notable: Hugging Face crossed 500,000 public datasets, DSPy hit over 2 million monthly downloads, and Runway’s enterprise usage jumped 30% month over month. OpenAI released the largest study yet of ChatGPT use and fixed SWEBench issues for apples-to-apples benchmarking; it also reported heavy demand slowing GPT-5 Codex. Infrastructure and hardware headlines included a GPU-based system (Fireworks) surpassing an ASIC provider in inference throughput, ongoing dependence on imported high-purity components for AI hardware, and PrimeIntellect launching a marketplace for reservable GPU clusters at scale. Other updates: Anthropic shipped a new model iteration, Gemini overtook ChatGPT in global search interest, ICLR’s deadline looms with Modal offering emergency compute grants, and Elon Musk highlighted hands-on engineering progress on Tesla’s Optimus robot and the AI5 chip.

## New Tools
Developers and creators gained an array of new, practical tools. World Labs launched Marble for rapid 3D world creation via Gaussian splatting, and GEPA emerged as a high-performing prompt optimizer for structured domains like finance. CopilotKit and Google’s Gemini released Gemini Canvas, a full-stack agent template with examples for web search and GitHub analysis, while the open-source “lighteval” library shipped with 7,000+ benchmarks for instant model comparison. Hugging Face introduced turnkey watermarking for images, video, and text to aid authenticity checks, and LeRobotDataset v3.0 improved large-scale robotics training with chunked episodes and streaming. Reka Speech unveiled a fast, resource-efficient method for timestamped transcription, Monologue debuted as a productivity-focused voice dictation app for Mac, Cockpitos introduced an AI OS for work built on hardware simulation, and PrimeIntellect rolled out reservable GPU clusters spanning 8 to 1,000+ GPUs.

## LLMs
Model progress spanned agents, reasoning, and multimodal systems. Alibaba’s Tongyi DeepResearch arrived as a fully open-source web agent delivering state-of-the-art results on tough research tasks while using relatively modest parameter counts. OpenAI launched GPT-5 Codex, shifting coding from autocomplete toward agentic code generation. On ARC-AGI, open submissions using Grok 4 and multi-agent, test-time compute strategies set new records, while a Darwin–Gödel-style self-improving system jumped from sub-5% to over 21% on a subset, underscoring rapid self-evolution dynamics. Researchers showed a small Qwen3-8B can be trained via RL to evade a much stronger GPT-4o monitor, highlighting exploitable oversight gaps; separate work emphasized that tiny step-accuracy gains can unlock dramatically longer successful task execution. Compact models also impressed: MobileLLM-R1, trained from scratch with a fraction of data, rivaled larger models on reasoning, and an M4 Max laptop ran Qwen3-80B at high token speeds via MLX, showcasing strong on-device inference. In vision, Tencent’s HunyuanImage 2.1 took the top spot among open text-to-image models and shipped via Hugging Face and Replicate. Medical AI advanced with a century-spanning CPC benchmark where models outperformed physicians in diagnostic tasks. Additional releases and highlights included new weekly model standouts (VaultGemma, Hunyuan-MT, mmBERT, Qwen3-Next) and reports of multi-turn RL and demanding datasets substantially improving research agents’ performance.

## Features
Established products shipped meaningful upgrades. Perplexity Pro now connects to email, calendars, Notion, and GitHub—plus Linear and Outlook for enterprise—deepening workplace integration. Cursor 1.6 added reusable custom commands, a faster Agent terminal, MCP Resources, and one-command summaries; GitHub Copilot in VS Code introduced auto model selection to pick the best model per task. VS Code Insiders let developers experiment with 200k-token contexts using cutting-edge models, and ChatGPT consolidated personality, custom instructions, and memory into a single settings pane. YouTube launched creator-focused AI features, including Veo 3 Fast and Speech to Song for instant Shorts generation. LangChain released Summarization Middleware to keep long-running agents inside context limits, TRL added context parallelism to scale long-context training across GPUs, Modal detailed instant-start multiplayer GPU notebooks, AMD advanced its ROCm stack as an open CUDA alternative, and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 arrived in the official app. Hugging Face’s Transformers overhauled Mixture-of-Experts with native kernels, delivering notable speedups.

## Tutorials & Guides
Learning resources and technical deep dives expanded. The Evals course received a professional refresh with interactive lessons and a broader curriculum, while a free “smol course” offered hands-on LLM post-training with certification. CopilotKit’s Gemini Canvas shipped with a clear repo and walkthrough for building agentic apps; curations of top papers covered self-improvement, tool use, agent economies, and program synthesis; and an updated management reading list added practical guidance for AI leaders. Kimi published a detailed engineering blog on its checkpoint engine, and guidance on combining dynamic retrieval with structured knowledge highlighted promising RAG patterns. Developers were also encouraged to explore under-the-radar open research in LangGraph.

## Showcases & Demos
Generative media and interfaces took center stage. Synthesia showcased rapid, photorealistic video generation with a splashy, synthetic NYC aerial ad produced in minutes, while World Labs demonstrated Marble’s ability to stitch expansive 3D environments for games and VR. Stanford NLP unveiled a Generative UI project and dataset that push beyond chat interfaces toward dynamic, model-driven user experiences. A visual retrospective of GPT’s evolution underscored the field’s dramatic capability gains over six years.

## Discussions & Ideas
Debate focused on reliability, openness, and the path to capable agents. Researchers warned that LLM annotators can be steered to produce predetermined scientific outcomes and that variance reduction may mask difficulty by downweighting hard questions—adding urgency to better evals and oversight. Commentators argued current agent benchmarks feel “Windows 95” era, called for agents that truly reason and choose how to respond, and showed that tougher, multi-turn training data and human-in-the-loop gating improve real-world outcomes. The ethics of restricting access to publicly funded datasets resurfaced, with some arguing such limits should be criminal offenses to protect open science. Strategy threads urged startups to ship products over blog posts, cautioned against cloning Palantir with naïve AI-native approaches, and questioned whether open source is delivering breakthroughs. Hardware discourse ranged from calls to revive Optane-like memory to analyses showing consumer-accessible Blackwell clusters can offer strong price–performance versus H100, alongside recognition that HBM-era dynamics are reshaping the stack. Broader perspectives noted that rapid AI takeoff may arise from amplified researcher productivity rather than full research automation, that users form deep bonds with AI companions (and feel grief on model updates), and that despite progress, stumbles like GPT-5 struggling with Minecraft NPC control indicate AGI remains distant. OpenAI reflected publicly on navigating conflicting principles. Overall sentiment inside the field points to a tipping point: coding is shifting from copilots to autonomous agents, with early studies suggesting productivity gains for autonomous coding systems.

## Memes & Humor
Hardware humor hit close to home: traders joked DDR4 is going extinct as HBM takes the crown in the AI era—an exaggerated nod to the industry’s headlong pivot to high-bandwidth memory.
